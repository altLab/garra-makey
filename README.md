# A Garra Makey

A Garra Makey (The Makey Claw), is an altLab project for the Lisbon
Maker Faire 2016. It is a modified carnival claw machine with custom
open hardware controllers. Everyone is invited to build their own
controller and drop by altLab's booth at the Maker Faire to try their
luck.

In this repository you can find:

 * doc/: documentation about the command protocol
 * hardware/
   * master: hardware schematics for the claw machine control board
   * control: hardware schematic for the example control board
 * code/
   * master: the Arduino code for the claw machine firmware
   * control: the Arduino code for an example control board
   * simulator: a Processing simulator to help test control boards
